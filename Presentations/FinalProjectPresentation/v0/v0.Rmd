## Presentation Overview (1/2)

\begin{center}
  \textbf{\underline{\Large{Analysis Summary}}}
\end{center}

- \large{What problem is being addressed?}
  - Single-Cell (SC) data increasing prevalence
  - SC data with multiple subjects emerging for analysis
  - Not clear how to analyze subject level relationships 

- \large{What needs to be done?}
  - Demonstrate: existing statistical methods can account for subject level relationships (SLRs) (in SC data)
  - Compare: how each method differs/resembles the others  

- \large{What do I do to address the problem?}
  - Outline five modeling methods
    - Demonstrate: how (if) the models account for SLRs in SC data
    - Compare: how model frameworks compare in theory
  - Apply modeling methods to a motivating SC data example 
    - Demonstrate:

## Introduction: Motivation

- Bulk Sequencing Methods:
  - Analylize combined expression of thousand/millions of cells
  - Often fail to capture underlying variability within sample profiles

\vspace{5pt}

- Since Cell (SC) Sequencing Methods:
  - Analyze expression measurements specific to individual cells
  - Hundred/thousands of SC measurements used to estimate espression variability within samples

\vspace{5pt}

- Benefits of SC Methods
  - Suited for detecting expressions differentially expressed across conditions[@bacher2016design]
  - Useful for identifying rare cellular subpopulations [@staahlberg2010defining]

\vspace{5pt}

- Technological Improvements in Producing SC data
  - Makes SC data easier, and more economical to generate than ever before
